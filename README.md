# usage

you make a folder and put some wav file samples in it

then you make an empty folder and give it a name

then you make a background image png that is 812x375

then you run this program

use the menu to choose your input folder the one with the samples in it

use the menu to choose your output folder the empty one you gave it a name

use the menu to choose your background png (hint: if you just save it on your desktop as bg.png it will be automatically selected)

use the up down arrows for the start note to choose where on the keyboard the samples will get laid out from. the default is 21 because that's the lowest note on an 88-key keyboard but you can set it to 0 if you intend to use this thing mainly from a piano roll

then use the menu to build the library

the library will be sitting next to the output folder and you copy that whatever.dslibrary file to the place where Decent Sampler keeps it's presets

on my machine that folder is C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Decidedly\DecentSampler\Sample Libraries

that's it good luck have fun

# tips

you can use audacity to make a macro to convert non-wav files into wavs https://www.audacityteam.org
